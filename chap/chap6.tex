\chapter{总结与展望}

In this study, we propose to use long-short interest model to utilize the rich
sequential information on users' interaction history to solve the rating
prediction task in recommender system.
By incorporating the sequential features into feature based collaborative
filtering framework, better prediction performance can be obtained.
Our thorough evaluation, using three standard MovieLens datasets, demonstrates
the effectiveness of the proposed method.
